[![CI](https://github.com/AlexMaclean/racket-openfst/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlexMaclean/racket-openfst/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This package provides Racket bindings for OpenFst, "a library for constructing, combining,
optimizing, and searching _weighted finite-state transducers_ (FSTs)" \[[openfst](https://www.openfst.org)].
Extensions to OpenFst based on the Python package `pynini` are also included \[[pynini](https://pypi.org/project/pynini/)].
